Getting started as a Corda Operator
===================================

**Set expectations:**

Being a Corda operator means running your own node, and possibly taking responsibility for some network or business network tasks.

In the quickstart we're gonna go through:

1. A thing.
2. Another thing.
3. A third thing.
4. Maybe a fourth if we're feeling spicy.

Thing the first
---------------

You probably want some pre-reqs or requirements here, no instructions if we can help it. Just - go get these things. If we're feeling snazzy maybe we can have a download link to a docker image or git repo people can build from for the quickstart?
