Growing beyond quickstart
=========================

Now that you've deployed a CorDapp where do you go from here? **chris maybe you can help with this**

Ideas:

1. Develop your CorDapp further <link to main CorDapps chapter>
2. Read our developer resources and APIs <link to APIs>
3. Meet up with other developers and maybe learn something I dunno <link to meetups/bootcamps>
4. Another three?


explore different options for expansion. lego!
