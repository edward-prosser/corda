CorDapp Quickstart
==================

Developing a CorDapp is a lot like learning to ride a bicycle. At first you need stabilisers; and you've got your good buddy Ed pushing you along through this quickstart environment, then we let you graduate to big boy school and we push you out into traffic.

In this quickstart, you'll download a skeleton CorDapp, as well as a development environment running in/with/on/using IntelliJ, and

Getting your environment set up
-------------------------------

To get set up for developing a CorDapp there are a few things you need:

1. Install IntelliJ
2. Install Java 8 SDK.
3. Install Git.
4. Clone this git repo with the cordapp in it.
5. Do that other stuff to get intelliJ set up I can't remember what it is. **this is the bit that actually requires instructions, project setup**

-- try a one-page solution.


1. dev-qs-1 ----- go over ONE PIECE of structure, and code it (e.g. THIS IS A WHERE THE STATE LIVES IN THE PROJECT AND WHAT IT IS, LET'S MAKE IT)
2. dev-qs-2 ----- repeat last step until all code complete
3. dev-qs-3 ----- running the cordapp, did it work? if not, here are some cheat sheets (properly formatted files) to work from
4. dev-qs-4 ----- here's an offramp to more detailed best practices/node configs and operators info/api docs and reference info for devs
